Tweaksort is a super fast composite sorting algorithm, which adapts itsself to the data
being sorted.

The paper I wrote is in a tex file, images in folder slike/, pdf version is also
avaliable.

The code of the project is in code/ folder, obviously. There is all the code I wrote, not
a nice selection. Only nice code is located in nice/ folder.

Main sorting algorithms are quicksort, heapsort, selection sort, insertion sort, and merge
sort.

They are composited in a composite tweaksort, based on experimental data, all of that
happening in learn.cpp

The tweaksort code is located in sort.hpp file.
